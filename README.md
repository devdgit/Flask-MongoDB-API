* **/api/$user_id/plan - To retrieve a plan associated with a user**

## Setup for project:

* **virtualenv venv - To create a virtual environment so that it does not disturb the other projects**
* **source venv/bin/activate - To activate the virtual environment**
* **pip install flask - To install flask**
* **pip install Flask-PyMongo - To install pymongo. It is a python distribution containing tools for working with MongoDB, and is the recommended way to work with MongoDB from python.**
* Now install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/). It is a Google Chrome app for interacting with HTTP APIs. It presents you with a friendly GUI for constructing requests and reading responses.
* Now install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass?jmp=docs). It is a simple-to-use, sophisticated GUI that allows any user within your organization to visualize and explore your data with ad-hoc queries in just a few clicks â€“ all with zero knowledge of the MongoDB query language.
